Bandits camp in wilds has loot in cave on the way to redlarch on cairn road. Well north of waterdeep.

Note said "please help they have prisoners". From the bandit who didn't speak. New recruit.

Masked figures around camp at night.

8 bandits. They had kidnapped cult members

In cave. Symbol of cult earth. A red equilat triangle, point up with a line from middle to bottom line. The symbol signifies purpose and stability. Members often identify themselves with a hand gesture (triangle with thumbs and forefingers)

Lance rock: winds, fog, lightning bolts.

in cave: Orioths journal. killed 4 rats. put in jar with mead and drowned it? Journal 2 says he was apprenticed to a necromancer. J3: Master left. Decided to get an army of corpses. I'll be the Lord of Lance rock

Killed Orioth. On return, after resting there was symbol of Cult of Howling Hatred left behind with fresh corpse in pit

Air corpse in pit with roughly drawn map towards feathergale spire

Caught two cult of howling hatred. They showed us hand signal. Vulture mount lives at feathergale spire.

Aerisi Kalineoth is leader of howling hatred wind cult. Tall and slender moon elf with wings. Whispers and calls all noble subjects.

Cult of howling hatred seem to have a hit out on us based on a vision.

Gael tools

In the swinging sword (sleeping) inn:
   Kalessa gave quest in bar.
   Galeeda was loud person. Perhaps recognised leader of cult of howling hatred.

In inn of helm at high sun gaelen runs the bar, justin is his partner:
   The mirrabar delegation was last seen in beliard... from a caravan guard
   A shopkeeper said a dozen beautiful old dwarvern books showed up in the cargo of a shady keelboat skipper in womford. Someone overseeing had recognised that at least a couple belonged to delegation members

One of the delegates was a shield dwarf historian. The harpers dont want sage or books to fall into the wrong hands. One of the delegates was transporting body of a knight killed fighting orcs in spine of the world. Was to be buried at summit hall

Delegation was a large well armed party.

Howling wind ambushed carriage

Iron, carriage driver was working for cult of howling hatred. Galeeda supposedly doesn't. Iron leaves scrap of paper under table 9 at swinging sword.

The howling hatred believe in destruction as means to an end or as a form of personal expression. They are looking for a powerful relic. It is connected to 3 other relics. When assembled it can be used for godlike power.

Cult of the black earth "coarse rude, stubborn". The crushing wave are flexible and inventive. Cult of eternal flame. Cult of the earth were trying to make a deal with the cult of the crushing wave to transport people. Cults coming together caused the elemental disturbances

The delgates travelled from west bridge to belliard and crossed the stone bridge from belliard they headed into sumber hills bound for summit hall. Earth cult attacked them. They were headed for sacred stone monastry southwest of belliard. They needed help of cult of crushing wave to cross a river. Scarlet moon hall is owned by the fire cultists.

We continue to feathergale spire. Haunted keep inhabited by feathergale society, waterdavian arial mount enthusiasts. "The Feathergale knights"

On the way to the Stone Monastry we found a corpse which was attacked by wild animals. It was carrying a coded note: "ask for hellenrae and they will know youre with the earth cult". Delegate had robe and gargoyle mask.

Urnrayle signature on two of the gargoyle statues in the garden of stone monastry.

Bruldenthar is part of the delegation. The earth cult attacked south of beliard. Air cult attacked and captured Deseyna Norvael. Other Captives ferried to stone monastry. Sages books were used as payment with the pirates to cross desarin river. Rhundorth and Teresiel were taken below to an unknown fate. Jorth in the guardroom carries the keys to the pens.

Overheard in stone monestry kitchen: Renwick is a lich. Doesn't like cult and is not a part.

We killed the orog guards downstairs. M16 is where renwick is (according to a freed prisoner)

Chief lieutenant upstairs is helenrae. Lost her sight as child. Bitter angry very into cult. Wears golden gargoyle mask with no eye holes. Barely tolerates other black earth cultists.

Marlos urnrayle is other leader. He is the earth prophet of elemental evil. Has mask encrusted with jewels. He is a medusa.

Used orog's key to get downstairs. A bridge with gargoyles on it. They didn't attack when we made the triangle gesture

Narthurm the burrow shark, Bullette was called Oggy, was the guard at B3. Hobgoblins called Jack, Durge, Cecil and Pete. Dwergurs in B5. B7 is where 'we' sleep.

Miraj Vizann is in black and white robes. Doing things in room with dwarf statues in B8

Ettin in B12. Norbs run keep out. Brug's run norb is stupid.

B15 is a forge with a Dao and underdwarfs. We killed former guard and torturer B14. We know there are ogres in B16 guarding other temple connection

Rucklemuth glitterstone was rescued from B23 (pit with black pudding). Marlos is in a cave to the north east (likely B22). Elemental nodes were created by cultists in the caves below. Could be source of the elemental powers.

Scarlen glitterstone missing in "the fane" below.

B19 is a statue (of an elemental prince), in the rubble of an old statue.

B21, filled with statues, which are obvious petrifications.

We killed the medusa, Marlos. A shadow demon escaped somewhere to the north.

Went to sleep in room 23, then killed stonemelder in B6 (who tried to bargain with info on guy in B8), and zombied other two in B6. Killed 5 cultists in B20

Weird dreams or some shit.

"Hear me well, you have offended the elder elemental eye. Others shall be punished"

Helenrae (mask without eyeholes) and two golems in B13.

Genie in B15 gave up and let us take Gloves of Ember Hulk

Killed B8 mud sorceror guy.

Lich was called Renwick. Was actually okay. Let me access spells. Gave amulet to Corvyn who remembered him from legend as a veteran of the troll war. Renwick was an unwilling lich subject

Return to red larch. Belliard (adjacent town) was destroyed. A group of cultists were walking with a large spherical object.

Went to Feathergale spire. Saw cage with person.

Party played as being under "Lord Timblewart".

S10. Letter addressed to Thurl Merolsska on desk in spire from Aerisi Kalineoth saying they are pleased about outcome with altercation vs black earth and Thurl's capture of a prisoner (noble from waterdeep. They will interrogate further). Keep close watch on sacred stone monastry. Signed your queen.


Spyglass is pointing towards a dead body on the ground (cage person), and some knights are clearing up the mess.

A hooded figure can be seen entering concealed door in knifepoint gully.

Feast in spire. Killed manticore.

They invited to let us join, but then were about to throw two water cult folk off the roof. Savra died. Thurl et all were imprisoned.

Shield of faith, mirror image still active
