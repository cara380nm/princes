## Features&Traits

### Character appearance

Flossie is a 3ft tall wizened gnome with gray-brown skin, short greying curly hair, and sharp black eyes. She wears a simple brown robe and carries no weapons besides a staff. 

| Feature   | Description                 |
| --------- | --------------              |
| Age       | 299                         |
| Height    | 3ft                         |

| Eyes      | Black                       |
| Skin      | Gray-brown                  |
| Hair      | Gray, short, curly, unkempt |

### Story hooks

#### Dangerous Secret
Through sheer curiosity Flossie wishes to investigate the relatively new and unheard of Circle of the Scarlet Moon. She knows that they plan on lighting up a giant wicker statue, with the intent of "burning out the wicked spirits that permeate the area.

#### Standing Offer
Months ago, Flossie served as a guide for a band of mysterious pilgrims who set out to reoccupy the Sacred Stone Monastery. Her research leads her to infiltrate the group and discover their intentions. Perhaps she can discover hidden knowledge they sought in the library of the temple.

#### Backstory
Flossie grew up in Volcanoside, a child of well off vintners. She showed early aptitude in the magical arts and was apprenticed under Magister Fuzzybeard at an early age. She interrupted her studies to join her two elder sisters responding to the call to head off the Snowgoblin invasion in the north. The Snowgoblin wars were long and hard, but the forces of good gradually prevailed. In the last major battle the young Flossie witnessed her oldest Sister miscast Evard's Black Tentacles at the friendly solders, killing her middle sister, a dozen young recruits, and horribly traumatising countless more. Since that day the young Gnome has refused to use magic as a tool of direct violence, and she dedicated her life to the pure pursuit of magical knowledge.
